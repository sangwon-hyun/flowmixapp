#+title: Application of flowmix to multiple cruises


** Summary
This repository contains the workflow for analyzing multiple cruises using the
flowmix model ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11251][preprint]] and [[https://github.com/sangwon-hyun/flowmix][software]]).

** Installation and usage
The scripts named e.g. ~00-covariates.Rmd~ are to be run in order of the files'
numbers. The relevant data files and outputs are placed in an identically named
directory called ~00-covariates~.
